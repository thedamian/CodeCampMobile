We’re breaking apart our large enterprise applications into smaller, more focused and reusable units of functionality which can be scaled independently. Sounds like a win right? But how do we know where the services live? How do we know what services are available?&#xD;
&#xD;
In this talk, we’ll briefly discuss the characteristics of microservices. We’ll dive into the topic of service discovery and take a look at a few basic patterns that you can implement today. We’ll also look at how tools like Consul, Zookeeper and others can be used to implement these patterns.</SessionDescription><SpeakerName>Cecil Phillip</SpeakerName><SpeakerBio>Cecil Phillip, originally from St. John's, Antigua, is a Software Developer residing in South Florida with years of experience building applications on the .NET Framework.

Sure, there are new framework features and development tools available; but, which of these things must be adopted and when? Can I still use ASP.NET Web Optimization for bundling &amp; minification, or do I have to use something like Gulp? Which package manager(s) should I use to acquire the requisite bits and assets? How does the framework support dependency injection for my controllers? Should I target .NET Framework, .NET Core, or both? What are the repercussions of my IDE or editor selection?&#xD;
Lend me 60 minutes of your time, and I’ll answer these and some other frequently asked questions. You’ll leave with a clearer picture of a practical migration path for your aging MVC application.</SessionDescription><SpeakerName>Scott Addie</SpeakerName><SpeakerBio>Scott Addie is an avid blogger, a Telerik Developer Network author, and a technical evangelist of the modern web.

Since Swift was open sourced there's been a lot of interest in using Swift on the server for web applications. Swift is a very fast, type safe and modern language that is a great fit for creating web frameworks. There's even now an official Server API project (https://swift.org/server-apis/) within the Swift team. &#xD;
&#xD;
Since Swift servers can be "Dockerized" they can be deployed to Heroku, DigitalOcean, or even Microsoft Azure. If you're looking to try out a new language on the web this is a great opportunity. You'll leave this session with the knowledge you need to try this great language in your next project.</SessionDescription><SpeakerName>Brent Schooley</SpeakerName><SpeakerBio>Brent is a Developer Evangelist for Twilio representing the Philadelphia metro.

And just when you thought, well I think I can decode that&#xD;
There were more wearing the SCRUMStudy, PMI or ICAgile hat&#xD;

Scaling Agile has further muddied the waters&#xD;
SAFe, LeSS, NEXUS etc. have their own scaling certifications and more Scrum Certification daughters&#xD;
&#xD;
I know what you are asking, there could not possibly be more?&#xD;
The answer is yes - CTC, CEC, CST, CAL.... just add to the score.&#xD;

In these situations, attention to core design principles often gets lost, with the focus moving towards just getting the pieces to work together.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is significant evidence that many of today’s developers are not even aware of core principles that have had a major influence in the creation of effective and robust systems. Even developers who once regularly considered such elements now only have a dim memory of them. &#xD;
&#xD;
As a result, many systems currently being developed are experiencing a category of problems that were largely addressed many years ago.  &#xD;
&#xD;
This talk will review a number of items including the set known as SOLID [originated by “Uncle Bob” Martin nearly 15 years ago) along with items that originated with Object Oriented Design. Common problems in today’s software development will then be correlated with the relevant underlying principle(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
By bringing these principles to the forefront we are able to demonstrate and correlate how a lack of attention to the foundational principals relates to common defects. &#xD;
&#xD;
NOTE: All code examples will be in C#, but may be applied to many languages/platforms/environments.&#xD;

Neural networks are a very powerful tool that enable machines to teach and evolve themselves.  You can utilize this power in almost any application.  Don’t be intimidated by the equations and Greek symbols of this cutting-edge technology, I will guide you on how to slay this technology and make it bend to your will.  &#xD;
 &#xD;
In this session, we are going to demystify the apparent Neural Networks complexity without the need of mathematical background providing an approachable overview. There will be very little math and lots of coding. The goal is for everyone to become acquainted with Neural Network from a pragmatic standpoint.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Just when you think it couldn’t get any better, I will show you how to employ the functional paradigm to leverage multicore machines and GPUs to make your neural networks predictions infinitely faster through parallelism. &#xD;
 &#xD;
By the end of this talk, you will learn the basic concepts of Neural Network and how to apply functional concurrency to estimate future stock prices at blazing fast speeds…and perhaps get rich while practicing.</SessionDescription><SpeakerName>Riccardo Terrell</SpeakerName><SpeakerBio>Riccardo Terrell is a well-seasoned software engineer and Microsoft MVP who is passionate about functional programming.

For some solutions, the security implementation is handled by the application itself. In this article, we explore the use of Azure Active Directory (AAD) to provide the security services for our web or mobile apps.&#xD;
&#xD;
The application we are building is a Node.js backend API with an AngularJS front end. We explore the following areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
•	Create an AngularJS App and use Git to deploy to Azure&#xD;
•	Add Azure Active Directory (AD) service authentication to protect our app&#xD;
•	Discuss the limitation using simple AD authentication when enabling anonymous access to some routes.&#xD;
•	Enhance our security by taking direct control of the Azure AD APIs in our code to consume the Jason Web Token (JWT) from the Azure Identity provider.&#xD;

The combination of these technologies enhances the effects of F# “code-quotation”, which allows the deployment of arbitrary Actors into remote Actor-Systems. You will learn the basic concepts behind Microservices implemented using the Actor Pattern and Actor Clustering, and how to leverage Docker containers for easy deployment. Docker is the new shining star in the dev-ops world. It allows you to easily deploy images to any OS running Docker, while providing an isolated environment for the applications running inside the container image. Akka.Net is a framework to build concurrent, resilient, distributed and scalable software systems. The cluster feature lets you distribute your Actors across multiple machines to achieve load balancing, fail-over and the ability to scale up and out. F# is a strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming techniques. During this session we will build and deploy an Actor Cluster to distribute an image recognition system using multiple Machine Learning concepts.</SessionDescription><SpeakerName>Riccardo Terrell</SpeakerName><SpeakerBio>Riccardo Terrell is a well-seasoned software engineer and Microsoft MVP who is passionate about functional programming.

Spark is the new Map Reduce, and it replaces all the headaches of creating long and complicated applications on Hadoop. Spark unifies, under a simple and concise API, different workflows so we can create very complicated pipelines in minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the new IoT world, the enterprise is aiming for streaming solutions that allow us to use SQL and machine learning algorithms (over hundreds of terabytes) at the same time we create and analyze complex social graphs. Spark lets us do all that without compromise performance, running up to 100x faster than classic solutions on Hadoop.&#xD;
&#xD;
There are few precise points about using Apache Spark. One is easiness of use, next performance, because no other framework can stand equally to it, and finally, extensibility, where every component is extensible enough so we could adapt it to any workload. Spark is just the future of high performance computing, and it something we want to get our hands on.</SessionDescription><SpeakerName>Nicolas A Perez</SpeakerName><SpeakerBio>Software engineer at IPC, an independent SUBWAY® franchisee-owned and operated purchasing cooperative, where I work on their Big Data Platform.
